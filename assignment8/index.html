			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>This app is a switch-controlled calculator with the option of choosing between 2-key or 3-key interactions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Instructions for using the app:</h3> The <strong>"a"</strong> key will select the next button, the <strong>"s"</strong> key will click the currently selected button, and the <strong>"q"</strong> key will select the previous button when in 3-key mode. Press the <strong>"m"</strong> key to toggle between 2-key and 3-key mode.</li>
				<br/>
				<li><h3>About the test:</h3> A test was performed to compare performance between the 2-key and 3-key modes. For each mode, three trials were run. A "trial" consisted of entering five different equations using the app, clicking "=" after each equation to get the answer and "C" to clear the calculator. Those equations were: 
					<ul>
						<li><strong>789+456</strong></li> 
						<li><strong>321/2</strong></li>
						<li><strong>5*5-1</strong></li> 
						<li><strong>1000+2020-2</strong></li> 
						<li><strong>753149/30.</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br/>
				<li><h3>Test results:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>2-key Trial 1: </strong>Time taken was 2 minutes 14 seconds, and 1 error was made (hit 4 instead of 5).</li>
						<li><strong>2-key Trial 2: </strong>Time taken was 1 minute 53 seconds, and 0 errors were made.</li>
						<li><strong>2-key Trial 3: </strong>Time taken was 1 minute 52 seconds, and 1 error was made (skipped the 1 button and had to cycle back around).</li>
						<br/>
						<li><strong>3-key Trial 1: </strong>Time taken was 2 minutes 18 seconds, and 1 error was made (hit "select" instead of "previous" in the middle of an equation and had to clear then start that equation over).</li>
						<li><strong>3-key Trial 2: </strong>Time taken was 1 minute 30 seconds, and 0 errors were made.</li>
						<li><strong>3-key Trial 3: </strong>Time taken was 1 minute 31 seconds, and 0 errors were made.</li>
						<br/>
						<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
						<p>For 2-key mode, the average time taken was 1 minute 59.67 seconds and the average error rate was 1.334 errors per trial. For 3-key mode, the average time taken was 1 minute 46.33 seconds and the average error rate was 0.334 errors per trial. From this, keeping in mind the tiny sample size, one might conclude that 2-key mode is marginally slower and more error-prone than 3-key mode. The one error made in trial 1 of 3-key mode is noteworthy, however, because it demonstrates the bigger cognitive load placed on 3-key users.</p>
